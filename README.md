# Installing Couchbase at scale on GCE

This project is about deploying a Couchbase Cluster on GCE, at a predictable scale, with minimum user interaction. Beside configuration, this would mean 2 command lines.

## Usage
### Cloning the repository

First you need to make sure you cloned this repo:

	sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install git-core
	[ ! -d ~/src ] && mkdir -p ~/src
	cd ~/src
	git clone https://github.com/blendedio/gce-couchbase-cluster couchbase
	cd couchbase

### Configuring Google Cloud Platform & project

First you need to create a project in your Google Cloud Platform, then configure the following settings in **etc/project.conf**:

	# Project Settings
	PROJECT_ID=<PUT YOUR GCP PROJECT ID HERE>
	REGION=us-central1
	ZONE=${REGION}-f


### Configure the Couchbase cluster

Open **etc/couchbase.conf** and update the default settings with you preferred values

The deployment method must be kept at gce, but more options will be made available in the future.

	# Couchbase deployment mode
	# Can be gce or gke.
	# Note that GKE is not supported yet
	CB_DEP_MODE=gce

The cluster machine type. Note that Couchbase recommends at least 4 cores, which you would get with n1-standard-4 devices. The size of the cluster represents the number of VM you want to spin.

	# Cluster Settings
	DEFAULT_MACHINE_TYPE="n1-standard-2"
	CB_CLUSTER_SIZE=3

For storage, we will use separate secondary disks, to make the vertical scalability easier. Select the size in GB, and the type of disk. If you pick local-ssd, this will result in the disk being colocated with compute, which is faster but less safe.

	# Storage Settings
	# This is the disk size in GB we set for couchbase nodes
	CB_DEFAULT_DISK_SIZE=10
	# This is the default type of disk we set for the cluster
	# you can use pd-ssd, pd-standard or local-ssd
	CB_DEFAULT_DISK_TYPE=pd-ssd

Network settings. If you want to put the cluster in a specific network, use its ID from the GCP UI.

	CB_CLUSTER_ID="couchbase-cluster"
	CB_CLUSTER_NETWORK="default"
	CB_CLUSTER_PORT=8091

Change the default settings only if Couchbase changes their default values.

	# Default Settings
	CB_DEFAULT_USERNAME=Administrator
	CB_DEFAULT_PASSWORD=password

Change these settings to add the password you really want to use, and rename the first bucket created by our script.

	# Couchbase settings
	CB_CLUSTER_USER=Administrator
	CB_CLUSTER_PASSWORD=p@ssw0rd
	CB_DEFAULT_BUCKET=defaultbucket

### Bootstrap the deployment

You just need to run the bootstrap script

	./bin/00-bootstrap.sh

**Note**: You need to be sudoer for this. Anyway the code will tell you if you can't run it.

This will

* Install all requirements for the whole project if needed
* Install the gcloud command line, and update it to the latest version if needed

### Deploying the cluster

Run the deployment script

	./bin/01-deploy-couchbase.sh

This will

* For requested each unit of the cluster,
	* Create a disk on GCP using the settings you entered. You can tweak this by editing ./persistent-data/couchbase-disk.json.template
	* Spin VMs according to the instance type, and attach the disk to it. VMs run Ubuntu 12.04.
	* Run a first bootstrap script that will format the drive, and install Couchbase 3.0.1 Community Edition on them
	* Create a set of networking configuration to open ports 8091 and 8092, create a load balancing IP address and finally create a TCP load balancer between units.
* Then, for the first unit only,
	* Run a script will harvest all other units into the cluster, the rebalance it.
	* Create a first bucket  

### Using the cluster

For some reason, the load balancer provided by Google doesn't maintain session coherence, which is a shame. That means that if you need to send a single request to the cluster (push or pull), you'll be fine using the LB address.

However, if you intend to maintain a session opened (for administrative perspective) then this will not work properly. In this case you should use one of the units IP address.
